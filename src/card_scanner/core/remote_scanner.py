A camera at a station: station_client.py runs the real CardScanner -
camera, outline detection, auto-capture, focus - next to the camera and connects here
(Socket.IO namespace /station). RemoteScanner is what the server holds in its place, one per
station: the same attributes and methods, answered from the state the client reports several
times a second, or passed on to the client and waited for. CameraHub takes the connections
and gives each to its station's RemoteScanner.

  client -> server   hello (-> the camera's settings and what the server decides)
                     status (state + detection status; answered with whether the preview is watched)
                     preview (JPEG of the annotated live view, while watched)
                     setting (a camera setting the scanner changed: saved here)
                     log, captured (the capture beep)
  server -> client   command (a CardScanner method, waited for), set (attributes)

The captured cards themselves come in over HTTP (server/stations_api.py: station_capture).
