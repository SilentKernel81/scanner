"""
Camera station: runs next to the camera, on any Linux machine. It finds the card, captures it
once it is still and keeps the focus (CardScanner - the same code and thresholds as ever), and
sends each captured card to the scanner server, which reads it, matches it and keeps the
collection. The server's scanner page shows this camera's live view and controls it.

    python station.py --server http://192.168.1.20:5000      (station.py, in the top folder, starts this)
    (or SCANNER_SERVER / SCANNER_STATION_ID / SCANNER_STATION_NAME / SCANNER_STATION_TOKEN)

or without any of that: the station then serves its setup page (station_setup.py,
http://<this machine>:8080), where the server, the station's name and the camera are chosen
and saved in data/station.json.

Little else is kept here: camera settings (focus, rotation, fixed area) are saved on the
server, and a captured image is deleted once the server has it. Until then it lies in
station_captures/ with a note beside it (<image>.upload.json) saying what it is and where it
goes, so that a capture taken while the server was away is still sent after this program -
or the whole machine - has been restarted. Resolution and the capture thresholds are in
config.yaml. See remote_scanner.py for the messages.

    # Captures that are not on the server yet
    #
    # The queue above lives in memory only. If this program ends with captures in it - a
    # restart from the setup page, a power cut, `docker compose up --build` - they used to
    # stay behind as pictures nobody would ever send. So each queued capture also has a
    # small note on disk beside its picture, and a new start reads the notes back.
    #
    # The note holds the capture's capture_id. That id is what makes sending a capture
    # twice harmless: the server counts an id once (server/state.py: seen_captures; pending.py: settled_captures).
    # A capture that was being sent when the program ended may or may not have arrived - it
    # is sent again with the same id, and is one card either way.
    #
    # The note also holds where the capture was going: the server's address and this
    # station's id. A capture is only sent on its own if both are still the same. If the
    # setup page changed either, the capture is "held": it may belong to another server's
    # collection, and which one is not for this program to guess - the setup page shows the
    # held captures and asks (send_held / delete_held).
