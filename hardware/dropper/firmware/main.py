# Card dropper controller: a Raspberry Pi Pico (MicroPython) between the station's GPIO pin and the
# feeder's two servos (card_dropper.scad). Copy it to the Pico as main.py (`mpremote cp main.py :`):
# the Pico runs it at power-up.
#
# Each servo turns its axle through a one-way bearing: a forward stroke turns the wheels, the return
# leaves them standing. So one card can take SEVERAL strokes, and a card pulled forward by one axle
# simply turns the other axle's wheels. One pulse from the station = one card:
#   axle 2 (behind the middle of the stack) helps the card start, and stops early - long before
#     card 1's back edge reaches it, so it never turns under card 2;
#   axle 3 (just behind the gate) carries the card until its back edge is about to pass it, and stops
#     there - short rather than long: a little short is a missed card (the station waits), a little
#     long is a wheel turning under card 2.
#
# Wiring, calibration and what was never tried: docs/plans/CARD_DROPPER_MECHANISM_PLAN.md.
# Never run on a Pico when it was written.

    """The station's pin, sampled every millisecond by a timer - also while a feed is moving the
    servo(s), which is when the station's next pulse can come: it pulses as soon as the card just
    released has been captured (and, with auto-add on, uploaded), and that can be before this board
    has finished bringing the mechanism back (a Codex review of 2026-10-23: a pulse then was lost
    and the feeding stopped for good, while the station counted the card as released).

    A pulse counts once it has been active for MIN_PULSE_MS (shorter is noise), and once only,
    however long it lasts (the station's pulses may last 2 s). A counted pulse is a REQUEST, kept
    until the main loop takes it - at most one: the station never asks for a card while another
    request is waiting, because it asks only after the previous card was captured, and that card is
    the one being fed. A second one while one waits is counted in `dropped` (it should stay 0) and
    not carried out: one card too few stops the feeding, which is safe; one too many is two cards on
    the pile (tests/test_dropper_firmware.py).

    A line that is ALREADY active when the board starts is not a request (a Codex review of
    2026-10-24): it is the pulse of a feed that a reset interrupted - a brown-out when both servos
    start, on the shared supply - and the one-way bearings kept the travel that feed already gave
    the card. Feeding it again in full would add a whole feed to that travel: axle 3 turning under
    the next card, maybe a second card out. So the trigger is ARMED only once it has seen the line
    inactive; a pulse that begins after that - also during the boot pause - counts as usual. A feed
    a reset interrupted is never replayed: that card stops short, the station waits for it, and
    someone clears the gate - one card too few, the safe side."""
