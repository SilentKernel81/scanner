// Card dropper for the card scanner: a 3D-printed feeder that releases one card per pulse of
// the station's GPIO pin (station/dropper.py), plus the landing tray and camera arm under it.
//
// Design notes, the numbers behind every dimension, the damage tests and what was never tried:
// docs/plans/CARD_DROPPER_MECHANISM_PLAN.md. The short version:
//   - the cards lie face up in a magazine without a floor, on six wheels - two on each of three
//     axles - whose silicone O-ring tyres make the plane the cards lie on;
//   - axle 1 (rear) only rolls; axles 2 and 3 are each turned by their own servo through a
//     ONE-WAY BEARING: the servo's forward stroke turns the wheels, its return leaves them
//     standing, and a card pulled forward by the other axle turns them freely instead of sliding
//     over them. Axle 2 stops early, long before card 1's back edge reaches it; axle 3, just
//     behind the gate, carries the card until it has nearly left the stack. A wheel that stops
//     while card 1 still covers it never turns under card 2;
//   - only the bottom card passes under an adjustable gate (its gap set with a feeler gauge, never
//     printed to size); it leaves on a short table, tips onto a chute and slides, on its back,
//     into a tray under the camera. The face of a card touches only the back of the card above it.
//
// Only the wheels and the wheel block printed (2026-10-29), never assembled, never run. Checked in OpenSCAD (collisions, a card's path) and converted to
// FreeCAD (freecad/to_freecad.sh) - see the plan.
//
// Axes: x = the direction the card travels (toward the tray), y = across, z = up from the table.
// x = 0 is the inner face of the sleeved magazine's rear wall; y = 0 the feeder's centre line.
