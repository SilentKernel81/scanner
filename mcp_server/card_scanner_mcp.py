An MCP server for the card scanner: lets an AI assistant (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, any MCP
client - also one that runs a local model) look at your decks and your collection and suggest
changes. By default it only READS: it asks the scanner server's web API, and `propose_deck_changes`
says what a change would do without making it. With --allow-deck-writes it can also change DECKS
(create one, change its cards, rename it - never delete, never anything outside the decks).

    mcp_server/card_scanner_mcp.py [--server http://192.168.1.23:5000] [--allow-deck-writes]
    mcp_server/card_scanner_mcp.py --check        (lists the decks and stops: is the server reachable?)

The server's address is --server, else the environment's CARD_SCANNER_URL, else
http://localhost:5000. It talks MCP over standard input / output (the client starts it).
The tools are in tools.py (plain functions, tested without the MCP library); this file only
registers them. Needs `pip install mcp` (README.md here).

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You can look at the user's Magic: The Gathering decks and card collection (kept by their card
scanner) and help them build and improve decks from the cards they own.
- Start with list_decks, then get_deck for one deck. 'owned' on a card is how many copies the user has.
- suggest_for_deck gives popular cards for a deck's commander and marks which the user owns.
- Prefer cards the user owns; say when a suggestion would need buying and what it costs.
- A card marked also_in_decks / used_by_another_deck is in another of the user's decks: say so.
- propose_deck_changes checks a change (legal? colours? owned?) but changes NOTHING.
- Every price is in the currency an answer names in 'prices_in' (US dollars or euros: the user's choice); 'unknown' means
  the scanner could not say - then do not name a currency for those prices.
- You cannot change the collection.{decks}
MTG Arena: a deck with kind 'arena' is played in MTG Arena, and the user has TWO collections - the paper
one and the Arena one (imported from an Arena export; collection_summary(collection='arena') says when).
- For an Arena deck, 'owned' is the Arena collection, and a missing card costs a WILDCARD of its rarity
  (basic lands are free), never money: talk in wildcards, compare with the wildcards the user has.
- Pass collection='arena' to search_collection / find_card / collection_summary / search_cards when the
  question is about Arena.
- To find cards for a 60-card deck, use search_cards(collection='arena', deck_format=<the deck's format>,
  owned_only=true, identity=<its colours>, text=<what the card should do>). suggest_for_deck only knows
  commander decks (EDHREC).
- A 60-card deck plays at most 4 copies of a card (basic lands excepted); propose_deck_changes checks it.
- An Arena deck that came from an Arena export (from_arena_export) is replaced by the next import: the user
  changes it in Arena itself.
