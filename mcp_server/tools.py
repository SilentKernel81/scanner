What the assistant can ask the card scanner about: the decks and the collection.

Every tool is a plain function taking the server's `ScannerApi` first, so that the tests can use
a stand-in and the MCP library is only needed in card_scanner_mcp.py. Nothing here changes
anything: the tools read, and `propose_deck_changes` works out what a change WOULD do and says
so - the person makes it on the decks page.

Answers are kept short on purpose (names, numbers, short lists): a local model does badly with
long tool results, and a cloud one is slower and costlier with them.
